1. Prompt user by ascking "What would you like [espresso/latte/cappuccino]: "
    a. Check the user's input to decide what to do next.
    b. The prompt should show every time action has completed, e.g. once the drink is dispensed.
    The prompt should show again to serve the next customer.

2. Turn off the Coffee Machine by entering "off" to the prompt.
    a. For maintainers of the coffee machine, they can use "off" as the secret word to turn it off.
    You code should end execution when this happens.

3. Print report.
    a. Whe  the user enters "report" tp the ´rp,´t. a re´prt should be generated that shows the
    current resource values. e.g.
    Water: 100ml
    Milk: 50ml
    Coffee: 76g
    Money: $2.5

4. Check if resourses are sufficient.
    a. When the user chooses a drink, the program should check if there are enough resoursces to make it.
    b. E.g. if Latte reqyures 200ml water but there is only 100ml left in the machine, it should not continue
    to make the drink, but print: "Sorry, there's not enough water."
    c. The same should happen if another resource is depleted, e.g. milk or coffee.

5. Process coins.
    a. If there are sufficient resources to make the drink selected, then the program should prompt the user
    to insert coins.
    b. Remember that quarters = $0.25, dimes = $0.10, nickes = $0.05, pennies = $0.01
    c. Calculate the moetary value of the coins inserted. E.g. 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, 2 pennies =
    0.25 + 0+1*2 + 0.05 + 0.01*2 = $0.52.

6. Check transaction successful.
    a. Check that the user has inserted enough money to purchase the drink he selected.
    E.g. Latte cost $ 2.50, but he only inserted $0.52 then after counting the coins the program should say
    "Sorry, that's not enough money. Money refunded.".
    b. But if the user has inserted enough money, than the cost of the drink gets added to the machine as the
    profit and this will bi reflected the next time "report is triggered.
    E.g.:
        Water: 100ml
        Milk: 50ml
        Coffee: 76g
        Money: $2.5

7. Make Coffee.
